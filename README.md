## About The Project (Flashcard )
We develop this project with Reactjs, which have three pages.
1) create Flashcard page 
2) My Flashcard page 
3) Flashcad Detail page  with  share, download and print button

- create Fashcard page: We created input boxes for the create Flashcard page using Formik, and we utilised Yup for the validation.

- My Flashcard page: We created the My Flashcard UI component specifically for the My Flashcard page, mapped the UI, and inputted data into My Flashcard.

- Flashcard Details page : We designed a share popup slide with the link of the card and button to copy the link. Carousel to display the number of cards and their details.

## How To Use
1) Launch the flashcard maker by clicking the deployment link

2) Click the "create New" link, complete all the input fields accurately, and then press the "create" button.

3) In order to see Clicking the "My flashcard" link will display all of the flashcards you've recently generated.

4) If you click the "view card" button on the flashcard, the specifics of the flashcard, the number of cards, and a description of each card will be displayed. You can also click the "share" button to copy the link.
5) You can change card on card detail page by Clickin in "<" or ">" buttton on the bottom of carousel.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
